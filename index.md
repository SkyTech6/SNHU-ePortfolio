## Welcome to My SNHU Capstone Project

Throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, we are frequently tasked with creating a final project or even a full small application to demonstrate our learned abilities in the course topic such as a poker hand prediction model for Machine Learning or a school’s class registration system for data structures and algorithms. Then in the final term of the program they require a Capstone project where we take 3 previous projects (“artifacts”) either from within the program or personal projects and give them enhancements that demonstrate our new skills.
